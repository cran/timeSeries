## timeSeries 4031.107

- refactored the 'timeSeries' methods for `head` and `tail`.

- fixed a bug in the 'timeSeries' method for `stats::na.contiguous`, which
  caused the wrong stretch to be returned in the case of tied longest stretches
  one of whom starts at the beginning of the series. Similar bug was present in
  `stats::na.contiguous.default`, see my bug report to R-devel from 2023-06-02
  and the discussion there
  (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2023-June/082642.html)

- removed deprecated functions `spreadSeries`, `midquoteSeries`, and
  `durationSeries`.  Use `spreads`, `midquotes`, and `durations`, respectively.

- removed deprecated function `colStdevs`, use `colSds()` instead.

- removed deprecated function `.description`, use `description()` instead.

- removed deprecated 'timeSeries' method for function `cut()`, use `window()`
  instead. The method was not compatible with the generic function `cut()`. Now
  applying `cut(x)` on a 'timeSeries' object `x` will work on the underlying
  time series data.

- replaced the S4 methods for `zoo::coredata` and `zoo::'coredata<-'`. The ones
  for `zoo::'coredata<-'` were not working at all, since `zoo::'coredata<-'` is
  an S3 generic and the methods dispatch on two arguments. It is also a mistery
  why the methods for the unexported S4 generics in 'timeSeries' were associated
  with the corresponding 'zoo' generics.

  If `zoo` is not attached, the calls need to be prefixed with `zoo::` or,
  alternatively, since the new methods are exported, they can be called directly
  as `coredata.timeSeries()` and ``coredata.'timeSeries<-'() <- value`.

- added a default method for `time<-` to improve its interaction with 'zoo'.

- added 'zoo' to 'Suggests:'.

- removed the deprecated `dummySeries`, use `dummyMonthlySeries` instead.

- added argument `FUN` to the `timeSeries` method for `na.omit` to allow it to
  compute replacement values using functions, such as `mean`, `median`, or user
  defined.

- formally deprecated `removeNA`, `interpNA`, and `substituteNA`. These had been
  informally deprecated in the documentation for a long time.

- the help page for `orderStatistics` erroneously claimed that the input should
  be an univariate `timeSeries` object, while it is explicitly written to cover
  the multivariate case.

- moved package 'methods' back to 'Depends' to avoid subtle problems when
  'methods' is loaded but not attached. For example, it seems that 'Math'
  methods for 'structure' are not seen for `cummin` and other `cumXXX`
  functions, when called on time series objects (the other math functions work
  ok).

- `cumsum`, `cumprod`, `cummin`, and `cummax` now work on the columns of the
  'timeSeries' object and keep its class and other attributes. This is a
  breaking change since previously the return value was numeric vector, the
  result of applying the base R functions to the data part of the object. This
  was not particularly useful, especilly for multivariate time series.  With
  this change all functions from the S4 `Math` group return 'timeSeries' when
  their argument is 'timeSeries' object.

- stopped exporting some internal functions that were accidentally used by other
  packages (after those packages were updated on CRAN).

- Numerous improvements to the documentation and further changes in the code.


## timeSeries 4030.106

- removed UTF8 characters from NAMESPACE (fixes CRAN warning to that effect).


## timeSeries 4021.105

- updated and significantly improved the documentation.

- class `timeSeries` now has a dedicated summary method. Previously it was
  falling back to the method for matrices.

- `colCumsums`, `colCummaxs`, `colCummins`, and `colCumprods` no longer throw
  error for `timeSeries` objects when called with `na.rm = TRUE`. Fixes bug
  #2121 reported by Shane Haas.

- corrected USDCHF dataset. The year information was wrong (the data started
  from year 8295). The bug had been introduced in version 2100.84 when the
  dataset file was converted from a `usdchf.csv` to
  `USDCHF.rda`. `USDCHF@documentation` contains a short note about this change.
  Also changed the FinCenter to Zurich (neither the documentation nor the csv
  file contain FinCenter information).

- the original source file `msft.dat.csv` of the `MSFT` data is included now as
  `inst/extdata/msft.csv` (note the different name). The file had been removed
  in v2100.84. Note that there is a file ``msft.dat.csv` in `test/` but it is a
  modified and abbreviated version of the original file.

- `dummySeries` has been renamed to the more expressive `dummyMonthlySeries`.
  The old name is still available but is deprecated.

- The functions `returnSeries` and `getReturns` are no longer exported and will
  be removed in the near future. They are synonyms for the function `returns`
  and their use was discouraged for many years. Just use `returns`.

- function `cut` is now formally deprecated. Use `window` instead.

- deprecated function `seriesData` is now defunct. Use `as.matrix()` instead.

- deprecated function `seriesPositions` is now defunct. Use `time()` instead.

- deprecated function `newPositions<-` is now defunct. Use `time<-` instead.

- deprecated function `colAvgs` is now defunct. Use `colMeans()` instead.

- deprecated function `colStdevs` is now defunct. Use `colSds()` instead.


### Technical changes

- stopped exporting (almost) all functions whose names start with a
  '.'. Historically, the package was exporting all functions, including those
  start with a '.'. This should be of no concern for users since these functions
  were not documented but the developers of some Rmetrics packages where using
  such functions.

- the additional arguments of the S3 `timeSeries` method for `diff()` are now in
  its signature, which previously was `diff(x, ...)`.  An intermediate function,
  `.diff.timeSeries`, was eliminated in the process.

- the bodies of the methods of `series<-()` and `coredata<-` for signature
  `"matrix"` of value were identical. Now the body is a separate, unexported
  function, which is used as the definition of both of these methods.

- eliminated `.merge.timeSeries` and other redundancy in the implementation of
  the `c("timeSeries", "timeSeries")` method.

- eliminated `.rev.timeSeries` in the definition of the `rev` method.

- eliminated `.scale.timeSeries` in the definition of the `scale` timeSeries
  method.

- same as above for `.sort.timeSeries`.

- eliminated `.start.timeSeries`and redundancy in the implementation of the
  `timeSeries` method.

- eliminated `.end.timeSeries`and redundancy in the implementation of the
  `timeSeries` method.

- the function `.applySeries` is now defunct. It was obsoleted long time ago and
  was exported for historical reasons only. Use `applySeries()` instead.


## timeSeries 4021.104

- new maintainer: Georgi Boshnakov.

- moved package `methods` to `Imports`.

- fixed CRAN NOTE `Escaped LaTeX specials: \_ \_` in `methods-plot.Rd`.
